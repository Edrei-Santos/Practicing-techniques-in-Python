# Principal Component Analysis (PCA) Python

Here I'll put all exercises and notes related to PCA in Python.

I'm currently learning the subject in my "Multivariate Analysis" course at my university.

The book I'm learning from is "Análise de Dados Através de Métodos de Estatística Multivariada: Uma Abordagem Aplicada" by Sueli Aparecida Mingoti, teacher from Federal University of Minas Gerais.

The analysis were done in Jupyter Notebooks extension of VScode, so if u want to run the code, u can do it in VScode or if u want to just read the analysis, just download the html file and open it in your browser.
